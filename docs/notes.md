Each project has a similar structure. They each start with something we call *skeleton code*, which has some initial code and structure to it. Your job is then to follow the project plan and complete the code. Here's a very simple example of some skeleton code (don't worry if you don't understand everything in the code):

        #### 1. Import statements

        from sense_hat import SenseHat

        #### 2. Set-up variables

        sense = SenseHat()

        #### 3. Write some code

        sense.show_message("Hello world!")

You see that each part of the code is headlined with a numbered section. Each project will be structured like this. When you follow the project plan, you'll be filling in code in the sections that we tell you to. Note that you won't always work on each section in order! You might start off with some coding in section 3, go on to section 1, and the finish off with section 2, for example.
